# React.js / Redux Example Project
This is a example code based on reactjs and redux that i have made to learn reactjs/redux. It is initially created with "create-react-app".
Just have a look at the different branches that i made to learn it step by step. 

This code is based on different tutorials and websites.

The main branch is the master branch. There is the working example.


## Used technologies and frameworks:
- Reactjs
- Redux
- axios
- redux-logger
- redux-thunk (for async redux dispatches)
- redux-promise-middleware (for easier api/ajax calls)

## Branches
Check out the other branches i have made. Every branch is a a little bit more detailed/complex.
Main branch is the `master` branch.
